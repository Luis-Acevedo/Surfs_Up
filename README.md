# Surfs_Up Analysis
Module 9 Challenge

# Finding the Perfect Pairing
w. Avy is willing to invest a lot of money in opening ice cream stores in Hawaii. However even though he thinks this will be a good business venture he is unsure if the weather will cooperate. Nothing is worse than a rained out day where no one can surf. In turn that means no one to buy ice cream. And temperature plays a big role as well if it is too cold no one will look at ice cream. 

# Scooping Out Useful Information

![December_Info](https://github.com/Luis-Acevedo/Surfs_Up/blob/main/December_Info.png)

- Looking at the above if you just consider the average temperature both months look similar. There is only a 4.9 degree split between both average temperatures. On most days a low to mid 70's day appears to be warm enough.

- Standard deviations are not the same with Decembers being larger. This could mean in December that the weather is more unpredictable. From one data point to the next the spread is larger and with he minimum being 56 degrees it is 8 degrees lower than the June minimum and a little too cold for ice cream. 

- The third quartile for June is 77 degrees and for December it is 74 degrees. Over the years for both months we can infer that over 75% of days are have an average temperature of 74 degrees or high which is a definitely ice cream weather. 

# Cherry on Top

Now that we have looked at everything Hawaii and ice cream look to pair nicely. It appears most days are looking to be fairly warm which is great for business. However looking at standard deviation for December there is a potential that the weather could be more varied. As W. Avy is trying to decide if the shops should be open year around we need more data. It would be beneficial to run a query comparing rain and temperature data. As well as looking at each station separately instead of looking at them as a whole. This will do two things for us knowing where we should put shops based on station data, and if we look at rain and temperature together instead of separate it may show us a relationship to help us determine if it is more rainy in the winter months.
